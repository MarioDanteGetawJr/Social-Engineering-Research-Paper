# This is a mini-research paper on Social Engineering that I completed in a Cybersecurity Course at Wittenberg University.
Contents of this repository include: 
- PDF document of the paper
- PDF version of the PowerPoint presentation I gave on the topic. (Presentation was given in a short 'Debriefing' style)
